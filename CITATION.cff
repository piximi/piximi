      Piximi - An Images to Discovery web tool for bioimages
      and beyond
abstract: >-
  Deep learning has greatly accelerated research in
  biological image analysis yet it often requires
  programming skills and specialized tool installation. Here
  we present Piximi, a modern, no-programming image analysis
  tool leveraging deep learning. Implemented as a web
  application at Piximi.app, Piximi requires no installation
  and can be accessed by any modern web browser. Its
  client-only architecture preserves the security of
  researcher data by running all computation locally. Piximi
  offers four core modules: a deep learning classifier, an
  image annotator, measurement modules, and pre-trained deep
  learning segmentation modules. Piximi is interoperable
  with existing tools and workflows by supporting import and
  export of common data and model formats. The intuitive
  researcher interface and easy access to Piximi allows
  biological researchers to obtain insights into images
  within just a few minutes. Piximi aims to bring deep
  learning-powered image analysis to a broader community by
  eliminating barriers to entry.
